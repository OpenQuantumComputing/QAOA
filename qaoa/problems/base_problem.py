class Problem(BaseProblem):
    """
    Abstract subclass for defining specific optimization problems.

    This abstract subclass of `BaseProblem` is meant for defining concrete
    optimization problems. Subclasses of `Problem` must implement the `cost`
    and `create_circuit` methods to define the problem's cost function and
    create the associated quantum circuit.

    Attributes:
        circuit (QuantumCircuit): The quantum circuit associated with the problem.

    Methods:
        cost(string): Abstract method to calculate the cost of a solution.
        create_circuit(): Abstract method to create the quantum circuit
            representing the problem.
        isFeasible(string): Checks if a given solution string is feasible.
            This method returns True by default and can be overridden by
            subclasses to implement custom feasibility checks.

    Note:
        Subclasses of `Problem` must provide implementations for the `cost`
        and `create_circuit` methods.

    Example:
        ```python
        class MyProblem(Problem):
            def cost(self, string):
                # Define the cost calculation for the optimization problem.
                ...

            def create_circuit(self):
                # Define the quantum circuit for the optimization problem.
                ...
        ```
